## Age Groups
Created 4 *Age* groups with the following ranges:
<ol>
    <li><i>Group Range 1: 20 - 29</i></li>
    <li><i>Group Range 2: 30 - 39</i></li>
    <li><i>Group Range 3: 40 - 49</i></li>
    <li><i>Group Range 4: 50+</i></li>
</ol>
This grouping was generated with the following nested IF formula:
<p align="center">
    <em>=IF(Table_Name[Age] < 30, "20 - 29", IF(Table_Name[Age] < 40, "30 - 39", IF(Table_Name[Age] < 50, "40 - 49", "50+")))</em>
</p>

## Age Group Distribution
| Age Groups | Count |
|------------|-------|
| 20 - 29 |	546 |
| 30 - 39 |	724 |
| 40 - 49 |	401 |
| 50+ |	116 |
| Grand Total |	1787 |

## Education Level Encoding
For further analysis, such as regression, the education level categories are encoded with the following values:
<ol>
    <li><i>High School: 0</i></li>
    <li><i>Bachelor's: 1</i></li>
    <li><i>Master's: 2</i></li>
    <li><i>PhD: 3</i></li>
</ol>
This encoding operation was performed with the following nested IF formula:
<p align="center">
    <em>=IF(Table_Name[Education Level] = "High School", 0, IF(Table_Name[Education Level] = "Bachelor's", 1, IF(Table_Name[Education Level] = "Master's", 2, IF(Table_Name[Education Level] = "PhD", 3))))</em>
</p>

## Education Level Distribution
| Education Level |	Count |
|-----------------|-------|
| High School |	110 |
| Bachelor's |	768 |
| Master's |	568 |
| PhD |	341 |
| Grand Total |	1787 |

## Years of Experience Distribution
Created 4 *Years of Experience* groups with the following ranges:
<ol>
    <li><i>Group Range 1: 0 - 2</i></li>
    <li><i>Group Range 2: 3 - 6</i></li>
    <li><i>Group Range 3: 7 - 12</i></li>
    <li><i>Group Range 4: 13+</i></li>
</ol>
This grouping was generated with the following nested IF formula:
<p align="center">
    <em>=IF(Table_Name[Years of Experience] <= 2, "0 - 2", IF(Table_Name[Years of Experience] <= 6, "3 - 6", IF(Table_Name[Years of Experience] <= 12, "7 - 12", "13+")))</em>
</p>

## Years of Experience Distribution

| Years of Experience |	Count |
| 0 - 2 |	309 |
| 13+ |	504 |
| 3 - 6 |	475 |
| 7 - 12 |	499 |
| Grand Total |	1787 |

## Salary per Years of Experience
Salary per years of experience is generated with the following formula:
<p align="center">
    <em>=IF(Table_Name[Years of Experience] = 0, "N/A", Table_Name[Salary]/Table_Name[Years of Experience])</em>
</p>

## Note: Table_Name = Cleaned_Data
## Distribution tables and charts were created with PivotTables and PivotCharts
